```
sort-my-notes/step_definitions/main-feature.steps.js:16
       TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locator')
           at new NotesPage (/Users/anudeep/pdlc/code/pdlc-projects/tests/stories/PDLC-30-as-a-user-i-want-to-sort-my-notes/pages/notes.page.js:4:27)

   ? When I sort notes by title
       Undefined. Implement with the following snippet:

         When('I sort notes by title', function () {
           // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
           return 'pending';
         });

   - Then the notes with identical titles should remain in their original order # stories/PDLC-30-as-a-user-i-want-to-sort-my-notes/step_definitions/main-feature.steps.js:41
