# Simple Calculator App

## Overview
Develop a simple calculator app that performs basic arithmetic operations for users who need quick calculations without any distractions or complex functionalities. The primary goal is to provide an intuitive interface with straightforward functionality focused solely on number manipulation.

## Problem Statement
Users often require performing mathematical computations quickly and efficiently, especially in scenarios where they are not near computers such as during commutes. Existing calculators can be cumbersome due to unnecessary features like scientific functions when a simple calculator suffices for daily tasks or basic arithmetic operations only (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

## Goals
- Provide an app that allows users perform quick and easy calculations.
- Focus solely on the four main mathematical operators: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- Deliver an intuitive interface with minimalistic design for immediate understanding without any distractions from unnecessary features or complex functionalities.

## User Stories

1. **Addition**
   - As a user, I want to input two numbers so that they can be summed up.
   - Given the inputs of 5 + 3 = , then display "8" as an outcome after clicking on calculate button (AC).

2. **Subtraction**
   - As a user, given two values: '10' and '-7', I want to subtract them so that they can find their difference.
   - When inputting the numbers for subtraction like 10 + (-7) = , then display "3" after clicking on calculate button (AC).

3. **Multiplication**
   - As a user, given two values: '9' and '4', I want to multiply them so that they can find their product.
   - Input the numbers for multiplication as 9 * 4 = , upon hitting AC should display "36".

## UI Components
- Home Screen (Main Menu)
    - Button(s) labeled with "+", "-", "*", "/"
- Calculation Screens:
    - Display area showing input, operator, and result format `5 + 3 =`
    - A 'Calculate' button to compute the results

## Technical Requirements
1. Cross-platform functionality: iOS (iPhone/iPad), Android devices.
2. Simple UI with minimalistic design for ease of use on-the-go or during other tasks like commuting, reading etc.

## Success Metrics
- User engagement rate tracking using app analytics tools such as Google Analytics/Adobe Analytics to measure the active users and frequency usage per day/week/month after launch.
